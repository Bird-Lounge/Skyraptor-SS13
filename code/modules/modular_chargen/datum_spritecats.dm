/*
	Hello & welcome to modular_spritcats.dm.
	Due to the default setup, modularizing /tg/station's sprite_accessories & DNA systems is a necessity to cleanly add new species.
	This is tied into code/__HELPERS/global_lists, code/_globalvars/lists/flavor_misc, and a couple others.

	If you're joining me however many years down the line from early 2023, welcome to the madness that is SS13 development.
	Good luck. - CliffracerX/Naaka Ko
