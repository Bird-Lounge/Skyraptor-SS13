/*
	Hello & welcome to datum_newmutant.dm.
	Due to the default setup, modularizing /tg/station's sprite_accessories & DNA systems is a necessity to cleanly add new species.
	This is tied into preference classes (e.g, lizard species features) and code/modules/mob/living/carbon/human/species.dm to add arbitrary renderers for new mutant parts.

	If you're joining me however many years down the line from early 2023, welcome to the madness that is SS13 development.
	Good luck. - CliffracerX/Naaka Ko
