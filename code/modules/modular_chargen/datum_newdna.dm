/*
	Hello & welcome to modular_newdna.dm.
	Due to the default setup, modularizing /tg/station's sprite_accessories & DNA systems is a necessity to cleanly add new species.
	This is tied primarily into code/datums/dna.dm; as most features ARE stored in your DNA, which is both super cool, and a complete pain in my arse.

	If you're joining me however many years down the line from early 2023, welcome to the madness that is SS13 development.
	Good luck. - CliffracerX/Naaka Ko
