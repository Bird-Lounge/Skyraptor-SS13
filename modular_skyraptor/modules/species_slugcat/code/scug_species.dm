			of the Primary Group began a research project in tandem with 6 Small Stones to uplift the Slugcats to a more sturdy form.",

		"After many cycles of genetic engineering and aid towards guided evolution, Slugcats have ascended to a more recognizable humanoid form, trading some of their nimbleness for craftiness \
			and intelligence to more than rival their most notable compeititors, the Scavs.  When SolFed exploration probes entered orbit of Tallon III, they were contacted by Gazes At Satellites, \
			and soon Slugcats entered the collective consciousness of the Solar Federation.",

			As such, those who do choose to venture beyond their world must do so with their Iterator's express approval and guidance, and typically seek employ and residence within SolFed outposts near the Talon system.  \
			Slugcats who venture beyond Talon III typically retain the titles given to them by their tribe & Iterator, such as \"The Hunter\" or \"The Artificer\", although some take on the names given to them by their compatriots beyond the stars.",
