## Title: Pixelshift - RP Re-Positioning

MODULE ID: PIXELSHIFT

### Description:

Ports the pixelshift module from Skyrat-TG - adding the ability for living mobs to shift their sprite around for RP, like standing against a wall, getting in front of someone, or actually existing in a bed instead of hanging half off it.  Additionally, beyond a certain threshold, pixelshift *disables walkthrough collision*, allowing one to stand out of the way of a crowded hall or similar without getting shoved.
