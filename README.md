This is the codebase for a nightmare amalgamation built on top of the original /tg/station flavoured fork of SpaceStation 13.

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a corporate space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones.  Skyraptor Station is built on the basic SS13 formula, but tweaked for a more character-focused, roleplay-centric experience where stories can develop from round-to-round, all whilst still recognizing the tongue-in-cheek insanity of SS13 and being willing to poke fun at the Gods and their Fourth Wall from time to time.

## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

On **2021-01-04** we have changed the way to compile the codebase.

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
