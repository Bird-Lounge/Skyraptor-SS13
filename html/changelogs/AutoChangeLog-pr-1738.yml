changes:
  - balance: "The Meat Hook will now \"ground\" you whenever you fire it out at someone. You get a very small immobilization every time you fire, which \"upgrades\" to a full immobilization whenever you actually hit an atom and start to drag it in."
  - bugfix: "A chain should now show up as you drag in something with the meat hooks."
  - bugfix: "Meat hooks should no longer play the \"magical gun\" suicide if you were to use it, but instead do their own unique thing."
