  - rscadd: "The advanced fishing rod now comes with an incorporated experiscanner specific for fish scanning."
  - rscadd: "Added a new skillchip that may change the icon of the \"fish\" shown in the minigame UI to less generic ones. Reaching master level in fishing also does that."
  - qol: "The experiment handler UI no longer shows unselectable experiments."
