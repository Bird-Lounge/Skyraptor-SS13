  Data_:
  - bugfix: The detective's curtains can be closed again in Birdshot.
  NaakaKo:
  - bugfix: Bitrunners can no longer get mass-mindswapped out of their avatar when
      the wizard does the event. Something about machinery and magic not going well
      together.
  - refactor: Traders are basic mobs now. Please alert us of any strange behaviours!
  - code_imp: If there is only one option, radial lists will autopick it. This behaviour
      can be turned off via a new argument.
  - bugfix: Obsessed's moodlets (Both positive and negative) go away when the trauma
      is cured or the antag status is removed.
  - spellcheck: Changed candy description to read better
  - rscadd: Added a new ruin to Ice Box Station, Lizard Gas Station
  - bugfix: Cargo will remove/cancel orders from its cart if that order exceeds the
      available budget (both private or cargo) and the player cannot cancel this order
      manually. All order costs are rounded up to integer values
  - bugfix: Galactic material market will deny appending stacks to your existing order
      if it exceeds the available (private or cargo depending on the mode of ordering)
      budget & if it exceeds the available materials on the market. Galactic material
      market UI is overall improved.

  Melbert:
  - qol: Clicking on an adjacent dense object (or mob) with Spray Cleaner will now
      spritz it rather than doing nothing. This means you can use Spray Cleaner to
      clean bloodied windows, as the janitor gods intended. It also means you can
      fill a spray bottle with Napalm, I guess.
  - refactor: Any cleaning object can now clean a microwave.
  NaakaKo:
  - bugfix: The Syndicate Revolver now has a Syndicate Firing Pin on the Nuke Ops
      uplink.
  - rscdel: Remove duplicate power computer on oldstation ruin
  - balance: Operatives can once again read about the basics of CQC at a reasonable
      price of 14 TC.
  - qol: All Syndicate MODsuits come with the potent ability to wear hats on their
      helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald
      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
  - qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for
      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss
      it! Great for those operatives just starting out, or operatives who need all
      their baseline equipment NOW.
  - balance: Malf Ability "Robotics Factory" can now be purchased multiple times.
  - rscadd: Added Abnormal Eggs

  - qol: To avoid poor magazine discipline, most combat-ready personnel have instructed
      _not_ to put magazines into the gun loops on their armor vests.
  - bugfix: Bluespace launchpads no longer work on shuttles
  - bugfix: signals in circuits now actually function
  - bugfix: Paraplegics can now enter netpods.
  - bugfix: Fixes an exploit caused by teleporting out of a netpod.

  - bugfix: chameleon projector now can copy icon for storage items(backpacks, box,
      holsters etc) using right-click on it.
  - bugfix: Practice laser carbines can no longer be used to rapidly fire regular
      laser guns.
  - bugfix: Plumbing IV Drip has full control over its injection/draining rate. No
      longer displays the message controlled by plumbing system
  - bugfix: Plumbing IV Drip can be plunged by plunger again
  - code_imp: mod reskins now properly shows their icon when skins loaded from different
      .dmi
  - bugfix: The fire visual on mobs should no longer persist after the fire has been
      extinguished.
