  - bugfix: The detective's curtains can be closed again in Birdshot.
  NaakaKo:
  - bugfix: Bitrunners can no longer get mass-mindswapped out of their avatar when
      the wizard does the event. Something about machinery and magic not going well
      together.
  - refactor: Traders are basic mobs now. Please alert us of any strange behaviours!
  - code_imp: If there is only one option, radial lists will autopick it. This behaviour
      can be turned off via a new argument.

      if it exceeds the available (private or cargo depending on the mode of ordering)

  Melbert:
  - qol: Clicking on an adjacent dense object (or mob) with Spray Cleaner will now
      spritz it rather than doing nothing. This means you can use Spray Cleaner to
      clean bloodied windows, as the janitor gods intended. It also means you can
      fill a spray bottle with Napalm, I guess.
  - refactor: Any cleaning object can now clean a microwave.

      helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald
      helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing
      a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives
      prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!
  - qol: There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for
      success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss
      it! Great for those operatives just starting out, or operatives who need all
      their baseline equipment NOW.

      laser guns.

      shuttle

      not pills, patches, syringes or anything than can hold reagents. That & slime
      extracts, slime industrial extract & shotgun shell
  - refactor: Proteon constructs now use the basic mob framework. The ones encountered
      in ruins are a bit flightier now, and will briefly flee combat if attacked -
      only so that they can return and menace you again soon after. Please report
      any bugs.
  - rscdel: Remove duplicate machinery from russian derelict
  - qol: There is now a more convenient way to prompt surrender to emote - the Security
