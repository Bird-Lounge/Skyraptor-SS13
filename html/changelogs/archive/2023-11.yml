  Data_:
  - bugfix: The detective's curtains can be closed again in Birdshot.
  NaakaKo:
  - bugfix: Bitrunners can no longer get mass-mindswapped out of their avatar when
      the wizard does the event. Something about machinery and magic not going well
      together.
  - refactor: Traders are basic mobs now. Please alert us of any strange behaviours!
  - code_imp: If there is only one option, radial lists will autopick it. This behaviour
      can be turned off via a new argument.
  - bugfix: Obsessed's moodlets (Both positive and negative) go away when the trauma
      is cured or the antag status is removed.
  - spellcheck: Changed candy description to read better
  - rscadd: Added a new ruin to Ice Box Station, Lizard Gas Station
  - bugfix: Cargo will remove/cancel orders from its cart if that order exceeds the
      available budget (both private or cargo) and the player cannot cancel this order
      manually. All order costs are rounded up to integer values
  - bugfix: Galactic material market will deny appending stacks to your existing order
      if it exceeds the available (private or cargo depending on the mode of ordering)
      budget & if it exceeds the available materials on the market. Galactic material
      market UI is overall improved.
