  Melbert:
  - bugfix: The Paddy's Claw should be properly unusable in situations which it should
      be properly unusable.
  NaakaKo:
  - bugfix: Medical/security records now show an icon based on the registered trim,
      rather than showing a question mark for records with customized titles.
  - balance: Power crepes are now finger food
  - bugfix: fixes pokemon ai still being active when inside the pokeball
  - qol: You can use atmos machines, holopads, crayons, spray cans, and disposal bins
      while floored.
  - bugfix: You can close extinguisher cabinets while floored.
  - bugfix: You can climb onto a photocopier from the floor.
  - bugfix: The say TGUI would recognize :g (changeling hivemind) prefix. and give
      a visual indicator in it that you are talking in the right channel
  - bugfix: fixes cardboard cutouts not updating when held and using the crayon on
      them to change their appearance, and fixes the alt_appearance being added to
      the cutout instead of the mob holding it
  - rscadd: Added an option to deathmatch loadout dropdown that allows you to pick
      a random loadout
  - bugfix: In deathmatch, plasmamen are made humans and the UI supports more players
  - balance: Gorillas are faster, stronger, but not bigger too. Note while holding
      an item, they are the same speed as they were prior.
  - balance: Gorillas now have the understanding of languages as monkeys do.
  - balance: The Gorilla Cube Box for traitors has been replaced with a singular gorilla
      cube. Due to the aforementioned changes, this singular gorilla should be as
      scary if not scarier than 3 gorillas were prior.
  - balance: ' Magillitis Serum Autoinjector now grants the resulting gorilla a slow
      passive regeneration effect which kicks in after not taking damage for 12 seconds.'
  - bugfix: The North Star finally has a bluespace gas sender system.
  - qol: Blood Brother convert objective now explains who you can convert and what
      to do if you mess up with your flash.
  - balance: Nanotrasen, in direct response to the increasing danger posed by wannabe
      martial artists and rioters in the fringes of the Spinward Sector, have upgraded
      the impact dampeners found in their riot armor. Staff have also started to rediscover
      the value of medieval armor; it isn't particularly easy to topple a knight in
      a suit of plate with just your fists.
  - balance: Melee-focused armor is now more able to protect you from various RNG-based
      knockdowns, such as critical hits from punches (as well as the ones applied
      through the staggered status), shoves, critical hits with a blunt weapon to
      the chest, and body throws.
  - balance: Melee-focused helmets also protect you from head injuries, such as bottle
      smashes, accidentally hitting something dense during a tackle, and critical
      hits from a blunt weapon to the head.
  - balance: Bottlesmash knockdowns are less reliable in general.
  - rscadd: A new module, the Safety-First Head Protection module, protects you from
      head trauma! Available in most modsuits expected to take hits to the head often.
      And from roundstart exofabricators.
  - bugfix: Fixed instances where holochip/holocredits would spawn with a total of
      zero credits contained within.
  - bugfix: Disabled the popsicle stick maximizer. (Producing popsicle sticks actually
      deletes the input logs.)
  - bugfix: Newscasters no longer say "No wanted issue posted. Have a secure day."
      when there is, in fact, an active wanted issue currently posted.
  - bugfix: You may no longer make deathmatch arenas dark with a lightswitch.
  - bugfix: Blood overlays on items no longer leak onto other objects
