      in.
  - bugfix: A chain should now show up as you drag in something with the meat hooks.
  - bugfix: Meat hooks should no longer play the "magical gun" suicide if you were

2023-12-04:
  Melbert:

      your legs.

  - balance: most diseases can now be slowed, mitigated, and eventually cured through
      being well-fed, resting, and using spaceacillin. Curing diseases through this
      way will give you immunity if you experience them at their peak/maximum and
      aren't starving/malnourished when they cure.
  - balance: disease symptoms can be forestalled for up to 100 cycles with a declining
      chance of avoiding them over time using rest or spaceacillin.

      viruses if you don't take care of yourself by staying fed and avoiding spaceacillin.
  - balance: disease can be cured through direct injection or ingestion of cured blood.
      However, curing disease in this way does not provide lasting immunity. You need
      to naturally beat the virus or get a vaccine for that.

      the spread of respiratory illnesses from yourself to others. Contact transmission
      is still possible however.

      pharmacy access.

      on their stealth stat to help make up for early outing without a bit more testing.
  - balance: biohazard lockers now also contain a syringe of spaceacillin (in line
      with the orderable kit from cargo.)
  - balance: Virus severity is now also a function of the number of symptoms out of
      max your virus has. Experiment with different combinations using less than six
      symptoms to make viruses that are deceptively less-obvious and less quick to
      self-cure at the tradeoff of stats.
  - bugfix: False anomaly alarms now work.
  - bugfix: Being revived inside a legion now sets you free
  - bugfix: "in some rare cases gib() did infact not spawn gib\n/\U0001F191"

      the head while they are in a kill grab.
2023-12-10:
  NaakaKo:

      work now.
