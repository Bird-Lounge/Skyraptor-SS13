  - balance: "Operatives can once again read about the basics of CQC at a reasonable price of 14 TC."
  - qol: "All Syndicate MODsuits come with the potent ability to wear hats on their helmets FOR FREE. No longer does any operative need be shamed by their bald helmet's unhatted state when they spot the captain, in their MODsuit, wearing a hat on their helmet. The embarrassment has resulted in more than a few operatives prematurely detonating their implants! BUT NO LONGER! FASHION IS YOURS!"
  - qol: "There is now a Core Gear Box, containing a few essential pieces of gear for success as an operative. This is right at the top of the uplink, you can't miss it! Great for those operatives just starting out, or operatives who need all their baseline equipment NOW."
