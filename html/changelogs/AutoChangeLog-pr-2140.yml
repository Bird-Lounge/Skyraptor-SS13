changes:
  - refactor: "attack_slime is completely gone"
  - refactor: "slime lifestate changes now have less boilerplate code"
  - balance: "baby slimes do a bit of a less damage on the low end, but all slime damage is much more consistent"
  - balance: "instead of taking half brute damage, cyborgs are now immune to slime's melee attacks. Charged slimes attacking cyborgs now lose a bit of charge. They still get massive damage from charged slimes, and every slime attack flashes them."
  - bugfix: "slimes can now properly drain basic mobs and simple animals that they can damage"
  - bugfix: "slimes can drift in zero gravity"
