changes:
  - rscadd: "Engineers now have an RCD round start."
  - balance: "RCD construction/deconstruction effects can now be attacked in order to cancel them. You can get the anti-disruption upgrade disk to prevent this."
  - balance: "RCD construction/deconstruction is now slower if you already have another effect up. This does not effect reconstruction."
  - balance: "Both of the above effects do not effect the CE's roundstart RCD, nor any other RCDs such as combat RCDs."
