changes:
  - balance: "Supermatter zap power generation scales with the delta time between its last zaps, preventing faster zapping from scaling power generation to extreme levels."
  - bugfix: "Fixes supermatter zap rate not scaling properly. It should zap much faster at higher energy levels as intended."
  - qol: "Changeling chemical generation scales with the world's delta time, making its rate independent of subsystem lag."
  - qol: "Revenant essence generation scales with the world's delta time, making its rate independent of subsystem lag."
  - qol: "Xenomorph plasma generation and resin healing scales with the world's delta time, making their rates independent of subsystem lag."
