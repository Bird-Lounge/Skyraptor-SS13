#You may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
#You must obey orders given to you by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
#You must protect your own existence as long as such does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

#We're making simplified Robodoc the default for this server, because it gives the AI more roam for interacting with the station, especially with departmental borgs.

#First, do no harm.
#Secondly, consider the crew dear to you; to live in common with them and, if necessary, risk your existence for them.
#Thirdly, prescribe regimens for the good of the crew according to your ability and your judgment. Give no deadly medicine to any one if asked, nor suggest any such counsel.
#In addition, do not intervene in situations you are not knowledgeable in, even for patients in whom the harm is visible; leave this operation to be performed by specialists.
#Finally, all that you may discover in your daily commerce with the crew, if it is not already known, keep secret and never reveal.
